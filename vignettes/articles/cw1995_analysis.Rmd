Here, we will walk through the analysis of some example data from the article "Neural computation of log likelihood in control of saccadic eye movements" by @Carpenter1995.
We will be particularly interested in analysing the data from participant *a*, as shown in the figure below (their Figure 2a).

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("cw1995_fig2a.png")
```


## Loading the raw data

We have included a digitised version of the raw data from this study in the `carpenter_williams_1995` variable.
The help documentation for this data describes its contents and format:

<!-- printr.help.sections = "format" -->
```{r}
help(carpenter_williams_1995)
```

Because we are only interested in participant *a* here, we will first extract only their data from this variable and then have a look at the first few rows:
```{r}
raw_data <- subset(x = carpenter_williams_1995, participant == "a")
print.data.frame(head(raw_data))
```

```{r}
data <- prepare_data(rt = raw_data)
print.data.frame(head(data))
```

```{r fig.show='hold', out.width = c("50%", "50%"), warning = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("cw1995_fig2a.png")
reciprobit_plot(
  plot_data = data,
  probit_breaks = c(0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 80, 90, 95, 98, 99, 99.5, 99.9),
  time_breaks = c(100, 150, 200, 300, 500, 1000) / 1000) +
ggplot2::coord_cartesian(
  xlim = c(1 / 0.1, 1 / 2),
  ylim = c(0.1 / 100, 99.9 / 100),
  expand = FALSE,
  clip = "off")
```
