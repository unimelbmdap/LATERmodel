Description: Implements the Linear Approach to Threshold with Ergodic Rate 
    (LATER) model, which predicts distributions of reaction times and 
    summarises them with as little as two free parameters. Allows for easy 
    visualisation and comparison of datasets, along with fitting of datasets 
    using the LATER model.
